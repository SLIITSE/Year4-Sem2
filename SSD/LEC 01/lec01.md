## Software Security 

- Defend against software exploit by building it secure
- Organizational Change
- Long term
- Threat Modeling

## Application Security

- Defend against software exploit after development

- Masqureranding/ Spoofing -> Using identity of another principle without permission
- Message tampering -> Intercept and alert message
- Replaying -> Storing and sending them later 
- Flooding -> sending too many
